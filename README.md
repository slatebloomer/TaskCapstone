# Task Manager Capstone
This is a simple task manager project created in Python as a capstone for a HyperionDev bootcamp. It allows the user to add and delete tasks and assign them to users, as well as see statistics about the tasks and users. It pulls information from the tasks and user txt files and writes new info back to them.
